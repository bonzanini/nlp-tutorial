[Russel Winder](https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/short-biography.html) will be leading a project at PyCon UK 2016 to
develop a new open-source supercomputer, based on Raspberry Pis in clusters.

This talk will introduce the project, and explain how you can join in.

Following the talk on our [open day](/introduction/), Russel will hold a planning and introduction
session that day. On [Monday](/code-day/) work on the project will begin in earnest during the sprints.

**Everyone's welcome**. You don't need to be an expert or an advanced programmer to join in. It's meant to be a fun
project and an opportunity to learn. However, if you have an *actual briefcase* and some skills that would help make
the finished project look impressive, you'll be especially warmly welcomed...

You can just turn up and join in, but you can also [contact Russel](https://www.russel.org.uk/stories/contact.html) if
you'd like to help plan the project.

Don't forget to bring your Raspberry Pis with you.
