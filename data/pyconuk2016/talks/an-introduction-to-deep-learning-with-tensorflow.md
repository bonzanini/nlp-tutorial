TensorFlow is an open source deep learning library released by Google a little over 6 months ago, with a special focus on large-scale distributed execution and a pretty Python frontend. It adds powerful new features and concepts for the experienced machine learner while making this complex field relatively accessible to the newcomer, opening doors to fields such as computer vision, natural language understanding and speech recognition. In my talk, I'll introduce artificial intelligence and in particular deep learning from the roots up and show some practical examples of using TensorFlow to create deep learning models with Python.
